Venn-diagram 
This is the script for making a venn diagram from your gene lists. 
There is a sample data of DNA methylation of AML cells with different mutations (DNAMet.txt) curated from a Blood Paper.
You could try your own data as well to make venn-diagram and extract the intersects.
You could find the example of output files (overlap.rxt) and figures (venn-1.png and venn-2.png).
